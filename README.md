Project: Orion OS - A Web-Based Operating System Prototype
Overview:
Orion OS is an ambitious web-based operating system prototype built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It features a desktop environment with a dock, window management system, and aims to integrate various applications within its ecosystem.
Key Features:

Desktop environment with interactive dock
Window management system with genie-like animations
WebGL-powered UI effects
App integration framework

Current Tech Stack:

Next.js 14+ with App Router
React 18+
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
Framer Motion for animations

Project Structure:
The project uses the App Router structure (app/ directory) instead of the pages/ directory.
Authentication and Database Integration Challenge:
We are currently working on integrating a robust authentication and database system. To achieve this, we're leveraging the infrastructure from a Canva clone project, which uses:

NeonDB (PostgreSQL) for the database
Drizzle ORM for database operations
NextAuth for authentication
GitHub OAuth for user login

Integration Objectives:

Implement the Canva clone's auth and database setup in Orion OS
Adapt the "projects" concept from the Canva clone to suit our OS needs (possibly for app instances or user sessions)
Remove unnecessary features from the Canva clone (e.g., Stripe subscriptions, Unsplash/AI features)
Ensure seamless coexistence of our app rendering infrastructure with the new auth and database systems

Challenges:

Merging different infrastructures designed for distinct purposes
Adapting the "projects" concept to fit our OS model
Ensuring our existing components (Desktop, Window, DockManager) work with the new setup
Maintaining the genie effect and WebGL animations while integrating new features

Next Steps:

Analyze and merge necessary dependencies from both projects
Integrate database schema and operations
Set up authentication flow within our OS structure
Adapt the "projects" concept for our OS needs
Ensure all existing OS features work with the new infrastructure
Remove unnecessary Canva clone features

Goals:

Create a fully functional web-based OS prototype
Implement a robust auth and database system
Maintain high-performance animations and effects
Develop a scalable app integration framework
